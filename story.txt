In this story, there is a boy named lil John who gets a great idea to be a rapper one day. He goes on to pursue his dream by making music sitting by a beach in California and watching gets his inspiration for his records through every day's sunset. John dies happily by the beach when he is 75. 

Then suddenly John woke up and he was alive.  But the year was 3035, a dark
future ruled by androids.  The only hope for humanity was for John to engage in
an epic rap battle with the androids, who had lost knowledge of rapping.

John's diss track burned the androids' fuse systems and slowly, John was reclaiming back the lands from the androids. But fortune does not last as a specialized android, built for rapping, comes out and faces John on a 1 on 1 rap battle. If John beats this android, it could, most likely, save humanity from extinction. 

John is sweating, knees weak theres vomit on his sweater already, moms spaghetti from a recipe he remembered. The rap battle grew more tense by the second as rhymes were lobbed back and forth between man and machine. After a grueling 48 day battle, lil john collapsed to the ground and the androids won.

This was lil John's story ending. He ended a happy life, but then everything changed when he was born for the second time. His life was sad. And now, guess what, he wakes up again and lives his best life!

End of story, *mic drops*
